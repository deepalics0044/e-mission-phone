your trip such as mode choice. Please keep emTripLog on your phone for <b>at least
72 hours</b>. We request you to pull up your trips by clicking on the Trips icon at
the lower left of the page and <b>select your primary mode and purpose for all

tick ✔️ mark</b>.

Please turn on your location services. The application turns on GPS only when you are moving, so it will not drain your battery.
